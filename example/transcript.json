We use a competent but compact 7D model so that we can do the fine-tuning focus on design semantics. Then we collected tightly scoped UI focus training data, build a prompt to design spec pairs, and we use Lara, Key Lara, key representation layers only, which will provide a shorter, smaller computation resources needed. And we constrain the output to design DSL schemas. We distilled to a low latency optimized student model, which will provide faster inference speed."
