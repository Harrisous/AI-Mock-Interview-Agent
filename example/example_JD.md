## About Beautiful AI

At Beautiful AI, we believe that artificial intelligence should not only be intelligent but also intuitive, elegant, and accessible. We are redefining the intersection of generative AI and design, building tools that empower millions of users to create visually stunning narratives and presentations in seconds. We are looking for passionate problem solvers who want to build the engine behind the next generation of creative tools.

## The Role

We are seeking a talented AI Engineer to join our core AI team. In this role, you will be responsible for designing, training, and deploying machine learning models that power our flagship creative suite. You will work closely with product designers, frontend engineers, and data scientists to translate complex AI research into seamless user experiences.

If you are obsessed with Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, and optimizing inference for real-time applications, we want to hear from you.

## Key Responsibilities

- Model Development: Design, fine-tune, and evaluate state-of-the-art models (LLMs, Diffusion models) for text-to-design, content generation, and layout optimization.
- Production Deployment: Build robust, scalable inference pipelines to serve models to millions of users with low latency.
- R&D: Stay up-to-date with the latest academic research in generative AI and rapid-prototype new features to keep our product at the cutting edge.
- Optimization: Optimize model performance for cost and speed, utilizing techniques like quantization, distillation, and caching strategies.
- Collaboration: Work cross-functionally with the Product and Design teams to ensure AI features feel magical and human-centric.
- Data Engineering: Construct and maintain high-quality datasets for training and fine-tuning specific tasks related to design principles and aesthetics.

## Qualifications

- Experience: 3+ years of professional experience in Machine Learning or AI Engineering.

- Technical Stack
    - Proficiency in Python and standard ML libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX).
    - Experience with Hugging Face Transformers, Diffusers, and LangChain/LlamaIndex.
    - Strong knowledge of cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).

- Domain Knowledge
    - Deep understanding of NLP (Transformers, RAG pipelines) or Computer Vision (Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models).
    - Familiarity with vector databases (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate).

- Soft Skills
    - Strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

## Bonus Points
- Experience deploying models on edge devices or in browser environments (ONNX, TensorFlow.js).
- Background in computational design, graphics, or HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).
- Published research in top-tier ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR) or active contributions to open-source AI projects.

## Benefits & Perks

- Competitive Compensation: Top-tier salary and equity package.
- Health & Wellness: 100% coverage for medical, dental, and vision insurance.
- Flexibility: Flexible PTO policy and remote-friendly work culture.
- Growth: Annual stipend for conferences, workshops, and learning resources.
- Gear: The latest hardware setup of your choice.
